### Collecting important resources for learning/building/researching in PyTorch

There's tons of good resources to learn PyTorch and alot of important functionalities that I'd like to document so I don't forget.
These functionalities may be geared towards my research or just my understanding of PyTorch.  

Good resources: 

[PyTorch Github](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/tree/master/beginner_source) - Official repo with great introductory code <br/> 
[Udacity Github](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch) - PyTorch course with projects and examples <br/> 

Excellent explanations: 
[Batch Norm](https://kratzert.github.io/2016/02/12/understanding-the-gradient-flow-through-the-batch-normalization-layer.html) by Frederik Kratzert <br/>

Gradient accumulation:
